# Checkpoint Video

## Introduction

Albert Einstein once said, "The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know," reflecting the idea that learning unveils deeper questions and reveals the vastness of knowledge. As you progress through this program, you might resonate with this sentiment, and that's a positive sign. Learning programming, while highly rewarding, is also challenging, and determining when you've sufficiently grasped a concept to move forward can be tricky.

To aid you in this journey, we provide you with the opportunity to create a "Check Point" video. In this video, you will record yourself working through a randomly selected coding challenge while explaining your thought process. This practice, often referred to as ["rubber duck debugging"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), involves discussing code out loud and can help uncover gaps in your comprehension while reinforcing your use of terminology. These videos serve as a means to evaluate your grasp of key programming concepts and offer an avenue for receiving instructor feedback.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this lesson.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser; you should see a spinner.
3. Open Zoom, share your screen, and locate the record button.
4. Before spinning the wheel to determine which challenge you'll record yourself working on and explaining, consider creating one or two 10-second test videos to ensure that your setup effectively records both your screen and your voice. For an example, refer to this [link].
5. Once you are comfortable with recording using Zoom, begin your recording and spin the wheel!
6. Navigate to the directory corresponding to the challenge the wheel lands on, and open the `script.js` file to begin.
7. The recording should not exceed **5 minutes** in duration.
8. After completing the recording, you can upload your video to YouTube and submit the link.

## Tips for Maximizing This Exercise

1. Avoid overthinking; simply do your best. It's perfectly fine not to know everything at this stage.
2. Strive to use correct terminology as you discuss the code and address the challenge's questions.
3. Most importantly, have fun!
